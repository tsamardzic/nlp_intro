### NLP at the intersection of three disciplines 



<img src="figures/NLP_inter.png" alt="inter" width="250"/>


- NLP is an important part of artificial intelligence because language is the most prominent capacity of human intelligence. 
- The Turing test: another reason why language is central to AI
    - Not a test in fact, but a thought experiment
- ELIZA: a case that shows how easily humans are tricked into ascribing human traits to machines 
- Linguistics was central to language processing in the past, before the introduction of machine learning. Currently we see a big gap between linguistics and NLP, but the potential for bridging this gap is still there.
- Language processing was one of the first applications of machine learning and it remains a prominent challenge.

### Human vs. machine language competence

- Humans use language to name (maybe even to form) concepts by abstracting from real objects and events
- Regular expressions describe explicitly the structure of text (as a sequence of symbols), natural languages is similar but more complex 
- Machine learning results in implicit knowledge, so that machines can imitate how humans use language without any access to concepts and reality
- Modern machines do develop some concepts, but the relationship with the reality is still missing
