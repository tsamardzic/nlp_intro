### Encoder-decoder framework (similar to earlier seq2seq)

- One huge neural network
- Divided into **Trasnformers blocks**, each block consists of the 
- The **encoder** blocks provide the representation of the input, each block consists of a 
- The **decoder** blocks generate a new sequence, given the representation of the input, this is called **conditioned generation**




&nbsp; 


### Similar to word2vec: Training with self-supervision 

- Masked language modelling as a training goal (objective, task) 
- Cross-entropy (comparing probability distributions) as a loss function


&nbsp; 

### Difference with word2vec: Better, contextual, "dynamic" (sub)word vectors 

- We basically represent sequences of symbols (subwords), not single words
- The result of text encoding with Transformers is a representation for each subword segment in the given sentence. This is a dynamic representation because it depends on the sentence as opposed to "static" representations (e.g. word2vec).
- With the self-attention mechanism, we can extract more information from the context, we can select more relevant contexts.  


&nbsp; 

### Reasons for the large number of parameters

- Instead of extracting one vector per word (like in word2vec), we store and reuse the whole network, all weights
- Multihead attention: need to repeat the attention mechanism several times, with varied parameter initialisations  
- Stacked FFNNs encoders: need to repeat the whole encoding process several times to achieve good results  


&nbsp; 

### Subword tokenization: similar to previous seq2seq, different from word2vec  

(More details in the following lectures) 

- Control over the size of the vocabulary
- Dealing with unknown words

&nbsp; 


### Generalised attention: different from previous seq2seq: 

(More details in the following lectures)

- The notion of attention comes from encoder-decoder RNNs built for machine translation: it allows the decoder to select the most relevant encoder states when generating the output. 
- Generalised as self-attention this mechanism allows to find the most relevant contexts for encoding the input. 
- It helps increases parallel computation because the input sequence (e.g. a sentence) is broken down into many pairs of words; we can disregard the order of words. 
- Positional encoding: an additional function needed to make up for disregarding the order of words
